## Description

Pont is a cross-over between Flight Control and Frogger. 
In the game you control the ferry that connects [Amsterdam Noord with Amsterdam](http://goo.gl/maps/01P5p).
The game is playable on both desktop, your mobile phone/tablet with touch controls, and in AR using [the Layar App](http://get.layar.com/).

## Known issues

 * Playing in AR is a bit annoying because you lose some accuracy
 * Audio is buggy in many browsers (partially our fault, partially browserâ€™s)
